# Hospital-Management-System
In our project, Medreco - hospital management system, patients are registered, their information is stored, and doctors' appointments are also scheduled. 
Our programme has the ability to automatically store each patient's and the staff's information while also providing a unique identifier for each patient. Using the ID, a user can look up a doctor's availability and a patient's information. With the use of a login and password, one can access the Hospital Management System. A receptionist or an administrator can access it. They alone are able to add data to the database. The information is simple to retrieve. The user experience is excellent. Data processing is quick because the data are well safeguarded for personal use. 

There are mostly two modules in it. One relates to administration, and the other to users, such as patients and physicians. Access to the application is maintained through authentication. Managing doctor and patient information is a duty assigned to administrators. A patient database and a doctor database with access by the admin were created to accomplish this goal. Authorities will be notified of any complaints made by users. 
The patient modules includes prescription and appointment checks. The user may also pay the doctor's fees online.
